## **Project Criteria**

* [ ] Design, develop and implement a Backend for a web application using Python and a micro-framework:

    * [ ] PASS CRITERIA:

        * [ ] Design a Frontend for a data driven web application that meets accessibility guidelines, follows the principles of UX design, meets its given purpose and provides a set of user interactions.

        * [ ] Implement custom HTML and CSS code to create a responsive full-stack application consisting of one or more HTML pages with relevant responses to user actions and a set of data manipulation functions.

        * [ ] Build a relational database backed Flask web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.

        * [ ] Design a database structure that is relevant to the domain, including relationships between records of different entities.

        * [ ] Design and implement manual test procedures to assess functionality, usability, responsiveness and data management within the Full Stack web application.

        * [ ] Write Python code that is consistent in style and conforms to the PEP8 style guide (or another explicitly mentioned style guide, such as Google's) and validated HTML and CSS code.

        * [ ] DWrite Python logic to demonstrate proficiency in the language. 

        * [ ] Include functions with compound statements such as if conditions and/or loops in Python code

        * [ ] Write code that meets minimum standards for readability (comments, indentation, consistent and meaningful naming conventions).

        * [ ] Name files consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalization to allow for crossplatform compatibility.

    * [ ] MERIT CRITERIA:

        * [ ] Design a Frontend for a Full Stack application following the principles of UX design which meets accessibility guidelines, is easy to navigate and allows the user to find information and resources intuitively.

        * [ ] Design a Full Stack application that lets the user initiate and control actions and gives immediate and full feedback on data processes.

        * [ ] Implement a Full Stack application whose purpose is immediately evident to a new user and which provides a good solution to the user’s demands and expectations.

        * [ ] Create templates, writing code that demonstrates understanding of template syntax, logic and usage

        * [ ] Write robust code that is free of errors in all parts of the application. 

        * [ ] Fully document the results of well-planned manual testing procedures to assess the website’s functionality, usability and responsiveness. Include evaluation of bugs found and their fixes and explanation of any bugs that are left unfixed. 

* [ ] Model and manage relational data:

    * [ ] PASS CRITERIA:

        * [ ] Design a data model that fits the purpose of the project.

        * [ ] Develop the model into a usable relational database where data is stored in a consistent and well organized manner.
    
    * [ ] MERIT CRITERIA:

        * [ ] Describe the data schema fully in the README file.

        * [ ] Maintain database configuration in a single location where it can be changed easily.

        * [ ] Maintain a Procfile, requirements.txt file, settings file. 


* [ ] Query and manipulate relational data:
    
    * [ ] PASS CRITERIA:

        * [ ] Create functionality for users to create, locate, display, edit and delete records.
    
    * [ ] MERIT CRITERIA:

        * [ ] Implement working Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD)

        * [ ] Check that Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) actions are immediately reflected in the user interface.

* [ ] Deploy a Full Stack web application to a Cloud platform:
    
    * [ ] PASS CRITERIA:

        * [ ] Deploy a final version of the fullstack application code to a cloud-based hosting platform (e.g. Heroku) and test to ensure it  matches the development version.
        
        * [ ] Ensure that final deployed code is free of commented out code and has no broken internal links.
        
        * [ ] Document the deployment process in a README file that also explains The application’s purpose and the value that it provides to its users.
    
    * [ ] MERIT CRITERIA:

        * [ ] Commit often for each individual feature/fix, ensuring that commits are small, well-defined and have clear descriptive messages. 

        * [ ] Fully document the deployment procedure in a section in a README file, written using consistent and effective markdown formatting that is well-structured, easy to follow, and has few grammatical errors.


* [ ] Identify and apply security features:

    * [ ] PASS CRITERIA:

        * [ ] Use Git & GitHub for version control of a Full Stack web application up to deployment, using commit messages to document the development process.
        
        * [ ] Commit final code that is free of any passwords or secret keys, to the repository and to the hosting platform.
        
        * [ ] Use environment variables, or files that are in gitignore, to hide all secret keys.
        * [ ] Ensure that DEBUG mode is turned off in production versions.

    * [ ] MERIT CRITERIA:

        * [ ] Present a clear rationale for the development of the project, in the README, demonstrating that it has a clear, well defined purpose addressing the needs of a particular target audience (or multiple related audiences), explaining the data, and explaining the security features considered.
