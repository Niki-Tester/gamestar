## **During Development Testing**
During the development process, manual testing was carried out in the following ways:-

1. Manually tested each element responsiveness and appearance by running the application from the terminal, and opening the development browser.

1. Published the page on Heroku and shared with peers for testing and for them to provide feedback.

### **Manual Testing:**
* During testing, I used four different browsers to ensure cross-compatibility. The desktop browsers used by myself were:

  1. Chrome
  1. Firefox  
  1. Edge
  1. Safari

- Using devtools to simulate different screen sizes/devices down to 280px in width, allowed me to test responsiveness. 
- Additionally I used an iPhone 11 with Safari / Chrome browser, and Samsung Galaxy S21 with the Chrome browser, for further testing.

### **Known Issues:**


### **Code Validation:**

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project, along with JsHint for validating all Javascript used, along with PEP8 for all Python code.

- [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - [Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fniki-tester.github.io%2Fbattle-dice%2F)
    - 


- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results]()

    
- [JsHint](https://jshint.com/) - Which returned no errors. It is important to note that the /*jshint esversion: 6 */ flag should be used when testing via JsHint. You do this by placing this comment on line 1 of the index.js file.
